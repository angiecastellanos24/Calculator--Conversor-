## 1. Project Description

This project is a functional and visually polished calculator and unit converter inspired by Apple's minimalist design. It includes both a web version (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a backend logic version (Python), enabling users to perform:

- Basic arithmetic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `modulo`, `power`.

- Scientific functions: `square root`, `factorial`, `trigonometric functions`, `logarithms`.

- Unit conversions: `currency`, `temperature`, `weight`, `length`, `area`, and `volume`.

- Currency conversion in real time using the [ExchangeRate.host API](https://exchangerate.host).

## 2. Technologies Used

- HTML5, CSS3  
- JavaScript (Frontend Logic)  
- Python (Backend Testing)  
- API: exchangerate.host

## 4. How to Run

### Web Version
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
2. Use the calculator or select a conversion type.

### Python Version
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed.  
2. Run `backend.py` to test functions.  
3. Ensure you are connected to the internet for live currency rates.

## 5. Challenges Faced

- Integrating the currency API and handling request errors properly.  
- Making all converters work dynamically without reloading the page.  
- Keeping the UI responsive and clean across screen sizes.

---

## 6. What I Learned

- How to build a modular project combining frontend and backend.  
- DOM manipulation with JavaScript.  
- API consumption using `fetch` and `requests`.  
- Writing clean, well-documented code.

---

## 7. Future Improvements

- Add support for historical currency charts.  
- Save user conversions and calculations as history.  
- Include a dark mode toggle.  
- Deploy the app using GitHub Pages or Netlify.

## 8. Author's Reflection

This project represents my growth as a developer and my ability to turn functional logic into something beautiful and useful. It also reflects my care for user experience and design.

I’m proud of this creation and excited to keep building more.
