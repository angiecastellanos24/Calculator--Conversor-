# Calculator--Conversor-
This project is a functional and visually polished calculator and unit converter inspired by Apple's minimalist design. It includes both a web version (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and a backend logic version (Python), enabling users to perform basic arithmetic operations, scientific calculations, and convert units in real time.
